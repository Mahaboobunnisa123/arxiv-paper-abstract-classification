## Building Multi-Label Text Classifiers Of Scholarly Research Articles 

### This project focuses on automatically classifying arXiv research paper abstracts into multiple relevant subject categories. Unlike traditional classification, this task allows a single abstract to belong to multiple classes simultaneously (multi-label classification). Both conventional machine learning and deep learning models were explored.

### Key Features:
- Multi-label classification on real-world academic data.
- Preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF and Word2Vec.
- Traditional models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes.
- Deep learning models: MLP and LSTM using Word2Vec embeddings.
- Evaluation using metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
- Final predictions on new research abstracts.

### Results
- Traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes performed well with TF-IDF features.
- Enhanced model performance using label-wise training and binarization.
- Deep learning models (MLP & LSTM) using Word2Vec embeddings gave better context understanding.
- Confusion matrices and metrics show improved precision and recall for top categories.

### Future Scope
- Experiment with transformer models like BERT for better contextual understanding.
- Use full-text data instead of only abstracts.
- Improve label balancing with augmentation or resampling techniques.
- Deploy as an API or web app for real-time abstract classification.
